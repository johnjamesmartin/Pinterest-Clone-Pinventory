# Pinventory

This is a Pinterest clone that I called "Pinventory" (I know, it's a cheesy name). The project was made as part of a FreeCodeCamp track and combines Node, Express, Pug, Mongo and Mongoose, JavaScript, etc. to make a basic full stack app.

## Installation

Download and install dependencies (cd into folder and type "npm install"). Create a .env file and set environment variables like the following — replacing the following values with your own (you will need to create a database (MongoDB.net offers a good sandbox option that's free)):

DB_USER="someuser"
DB_PASS="somepass"
DB_CLUSTER="clusterX-something.mongodb.net"
DB_PARAMS="collectionName?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

PASSPORT_SECRET="somesecret"

GITHUB_APP_ID="someappid"
GITHUB_APP_SECRET="someappsecret"

SUPER_ID="userwhowillbesuperadminid"
SUPER_USERNAME="userwhowillbesuperadminemail"
SUPER_PASSWORD="userwhowillbesuperadminpassword"
SUPER_EMAIL="userwhowillbesuperadminemail"

BASIC_USERNAME="basicuserusername"
BASIC_PASSWORD="basicuserpassword"
BASIC_EMAIL="emailaddresshere"
