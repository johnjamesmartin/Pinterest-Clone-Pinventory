Objective: Build a Glitch app that is functionally similar to this: https://wild-song.glitch.me. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

~~1. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub. DONE~~

~~2. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

~~3. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

~~4. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

~~5. User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

Hint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
